### What is bluenose?
A CentOS server maintained by Dalhousie which each student has access to. To connect to it run 
```shell
ssh YOUR_CSID_HERE@bluenose.cs.dal.ca
```
Some classes will run automated tests on bluenose, so it's a place where students can compile and test their code in the same enviorment marking will take place. Also each student is given their own page on https://web.cs.dal.ca/~YOURCSIDHERE. If you want to edit yours, simply upload html or php files into the `~/public_html` folder on bluenose.
#### Working in bluenose
There is a few methods of working with bluenose.
- [VSCode Remote Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack): This is my personal favourite. You can connect to bluenose directly inside VSCode. This will allow you to write code as you normally would, although it would be saved directly onto the bluenose server. 
- [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/): Another option is using a ftp client. This is a slower method if you're constantly uploading/downloading, but could be useful if you need to move a bunch of files from your pc to bluenose.
